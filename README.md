# 🌐 Portfolio - Marcos Lezcano

Hi! This is my personal portfolio as a web developer.
🚧 **Work in progress** 🚧

Soon, you'll find here a curated list of my personal projects, freelance work, and some insight into how I approach software development.
For now, this is just the beginning... but **the best is yet to come**.
